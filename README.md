## Notes

!There is error 429 occuring during testing, looks like database has request limits on it. If you encounter this issue bear in mind that it was not set up by me.! 

I've created model files with only properties names used to access data necessary to complete assigned task.

I added "No results found" message if there are no filtered values.

The styling is not done as required because applying custom styles and custom icons to filter input would just take too much time. Task was supposed to take 2-3 hours and I'm going to keep it that way. Nonetheless functional part of the application is done.
